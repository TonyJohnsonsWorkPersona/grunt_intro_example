    <h1>Example3 Goals</h1>
<p>This example will show you how you&#39;d setup a minified and non-minified version of css and js. Technically this is only a minor increase from Example2, but I think it was important enough to split out so certain parts can be clear.</p>
<h1>Example3 Explained</h1>
<p>Debugging minified javascript is a pain, so its always nice to do development against an unminified code. In this example we&#39;ll be taking multiple Less files and compiling them into one CSS file, and then minifying them. We&#39;ll also be taking multiple JS files, concatenating them together, and then minifying them.</p>
<p>The first task is the one that does the JS file concatenation:</p>
<pre><code>concat: {
    prod: {
        src: [&quot;src/js/*.js&quot;],
        dest: &quot;dist/js/all-js.js&quot;
    }
},</code></pre>
<p>You might normally use this to concatanate CSS files if you were not already using a Less compiler. However, since I am using a Less compiler I&#39;ll just use it to concatenate all of the JS files.</p>
<p>The Less task you already saw in Example2.</p>
<p>The javascript uglify task is the next one:</p>
<pre><code>uglify: {
    js: {
        src: &quot;dist/js/all-js.js&quot;,
        dest: &quot;dist/js/all-js.min.js&quot;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The uglify task does basically what any other javascript uglifier/minifier does. This specific uglifier can do 1 of two things. It can aggregate the files and uglify them, or it can just uglify specific files. I&#39;m going with just having it uglify specific files because I&#39;d like to also have a non-minified version of the files.</p>
<p>I setup this Grunt file so when <code>grunt prod</code> is run an unminified version of the file will be created, and another minified verison of the file will be made. This way I can keep track of both version as I needed. The grunt task will first run the JS concatenator so that all the javascript files are turned into <code>dist/js/all-js.js</code>. Next the Less files will be compiled into <code>dist/css/common.css</code> much like Example2. However, the next two steps take those finished files, minify them, and save a copy off with thte word &quot;min&quot; in it. So <code>all-js.js</code> becomes <code>all-js.min.js</code>, and <code>common.css</code> becomes <code>common.min.css</code>.</p>
<p>I think if you go with a two file setup (one minified, one not) that its important to create 2 different Grunt tasks. One with the minification and one without it that way if you need an unminified version of the file(s) you don&#39;t have to monkey with your primary grunt task.</p>
<h1>To run this Example</h1>
<p><code>grunt dev</code> will generate an unminified set of aggregated CSS and JS assets</p>
<p><code>grunt prod</code> will generate an unminifed and minified set of aggregated CSS and JS assets</p>
