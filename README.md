#Intro
This repo was built as an intro to [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for [DSMJS.com](dsmjs.com). Since I like to teach in sort of an explicit manner each Example folder is essentially a self contained "project". I'd suggest you start with Example1 and work your way up.

#Using this repo
You must have the following done to use this repo properly. (I'll try to link to more detailed guides about these later)
* [Installed Nodejs 0.10.17 or higher](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Installled Grunt-cli](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started). Basically, in your command prompt type `npm install -g grunt-cli`

Once you've done that all you need to do is open a command prompt to where you've clone this repo. Then navigate into the Example you want to use, and do an `npm install`. Once you've done that look at the README.md file in each Example folder, and the comments in the `Gruntfile.js` file. The README file will help explain whats going on in each Gruntfile.js. If you have questions ping me @crolek on twitter or chuck@chuckrolek.com.
