#Example4 Goals
A you ready to "watch" something cool happen!? So you've got all of these awesome Grunt tasks, but who wants to type `grunt dev` each time they're working on something? Not me, so more than likely not you. This example will show you how to make it so Grunt tracks your file changes and runs any task(s) you want automatically.

#Example4 Explained
Before I get into the Watch command I want to try and clarify something up front. The files that Grunt Watches do not have to be the same files that are associated with that task you want run (most of the time they will be, but its not required). For example you could have Grunt compile Less files on any change done to an HTML file. It might seem wasteful, but there is probably a perfect case for it. Again, commonly when you configure the Watch you will probably have it the same files that the actual task is associated with. It'll look redudant, but I'll do my best to explain it clearly below.
